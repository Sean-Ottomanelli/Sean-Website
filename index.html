    </div>

    <p>My name is Sean Ottomanelli and this is my website.
    <br><br>
        I graduated from Tulane University in 2013 with a BSE in engineering physics, and 
        I graduated from Columbia University in 2015 with an MS in Mechanical Engineering.  
        I've lived in New York City for the past 8 years.
    <br><br>
        Currently I'm studying at the Flatiron School to be a software engineer.  
        Prior to my return to education, for six years, I worked in the AEC industry 
        as a mechanical consulting/design engineer with a specialty in commercial research lab design.
